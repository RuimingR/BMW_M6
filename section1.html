        As bimmer lover, I really like old BMW M performance cars, like old M3 and M6. While browsing <i>BMW M3</i> and <i>BMW M6</i> online, there are a few in Seattle. Most of them have a really high mileage and many accidents, especially for Old M3 since bimmers always like to modify and race. Luckily, I found one old M6 on sale. After calling the owner, I got to know he is also from China and we actually lived nearby in China. what a coincidence! After a few discussion, we have this deal.
